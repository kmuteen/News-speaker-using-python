This is a python program built using some popular python modules, using the indian new api it speaks out some news

# Requirements

=> Must have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed in your Pc
=> Json python Module
=> Requests python Module 
=> Pyttsx3 python Module

You must have them all

# Important

and furthur for using pyttsx3 as speaking module, i've used eSpeak which is a cross platform software
but if u are using windows you can use sapi5 as speak engine and replace "espeak" with "sapi5" in the code

Thanks
