# News-speaker-using-python


This is a python program built using some popular modules{ json, request and pyttsx3 }

make sure u have all of them installed

and furthur for using pyttsx3 as speaking module, i've used eSpeak which is a cross platform software
but if u are using windows you can use sapi5 as speak engine and replace "espeak" with "sapi5" in the code
Thanks
